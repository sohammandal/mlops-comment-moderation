# Data Folder

Put your data here. The comments data can be downloaded directly from Google Drive or from Kaggle + running `notebooks/data_prep.ipynb`. These two files below are **gitignored**.

```
data/
├── comments_train.csv 
├── comments_test.csv 
```

Make sure these files exist locally before running training or inference.
